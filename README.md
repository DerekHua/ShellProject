# Shell-Project
This project involves writing a command interpreter for a Korn shell-like command language in C using Lex and Yacc running under Unix. The shell will parse command lines and execute the appropriate command(s). The core of the shell consists of simple commands, pipes, I/O redirection, environment variables, aliases, pathname searching, and wild-carding.
